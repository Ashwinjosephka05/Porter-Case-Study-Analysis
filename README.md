📊 Key Findings

1️⃣ Delivery Time Performance

🚨 Only 14.76% of orders were delivered within 30 minutes, significantly below industry standards (70-80%).
🕑 Peak delays occurred in orders from Brazilian, Caribbean, and Spanish cuisines.

📌 Recommendation: Optimize driver scheduling and route planning during high-delay periods.


---

2️⃣ Peak Order Hours Analysis

🕛 Highest order volume occurred between 1 AM - 3 AM, requiring optimized driver allocation.
📉 Lowest demand was observed during 6 AM - 3 PM, making it ideal for promotions.

📌 Recommendation: Offer discounts & bundle deals during low-demand hours.


---

3️⃣ Market-Wise Performance

🏆 Top-performing markets: Market 2 (28%) & Market 4 (24%) account for 52% of all orders.
⚠️ Lowest market: Market 6 contributes only 7.35%, indicating potential operational issues.

📌 Recommendation: Optimize logistics & restaurant partnerships in underperforming markets.


---

4️⃣ On-Time Delivery Performance

🚛 Busy partner availability has weak correlation (-0.126) with delivery speed, indicating that adding more drivers alone won’t fix delays.
⚡ Fastest delivery protocol: Protocol 7 (43.16 mins)
🐌 Slowest protocol: Protocol 6 (60.55 mins)

📌 Recommendation: Automate order processing for slow protocols and improve driver assignment efficiency.


---

5️⃣ Order Trends & Pricing Analysis

💰 Total Revenue Generated: ₹529.57M
📦 Average order size: 3.19 items
💲 Order subtotal has a moderate correlation (0.558) with item count, but price range does not significantly impact order value.

📌 Recommendation: Introduce upselling & combo offers to increase order value.
